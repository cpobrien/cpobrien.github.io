    <h1>Hi!</h1>
    <p>I’m Connor. I grew up in the sticks of rural Georgia, only moving up to Canada for UBC when I was 18.</p>
    <p>I originally wanted to study microbiology, but quickly found that I liked and had a knack for programming, so I quickly switched my major. 5 years later, I graduated with a BSc in Computer Science.</p>
    <p>My first internship was writing internal web tools for the Compliance Team at SAP. My second internship working with VR in Unity at Archiact. I’m now working with the RDS team at Amazon Web Services, where I also spent my final internship.</p>
    <p>Aside from the Computer Science, I also ended up putting half of my credits into Chinese, and am still working on it. I also like playing with my drawing tablet from time to time.</p>
